- On the right, choose your bingo board size and other options.
  - Compact mode shrinks the bingo squares to only show icons - great for streaming!
  - Allow duplicates will allow icons to show up more than once on the bingo board.
If the Generate button is disabled, your selection likely does not have enough icons enabled to generate a Bingo Board of the requested size.

##Bingo Board
- Click the icons to toggle the background between White and Green.
- Hover the mouse over an icon to view a tooltip that shows the item's name, handy when using Compact Mode.
- A search bar at the top is available if the Bingo Board has 3 or more columns.
  - Type in the search bar to highlight icons that contain the search value. Found icons will be highlighted Gold.
  - Hit the Mark button to the right of the search bar to mark all icons highlighted by the search bar as completed.
